/**
 * One verify-and-retry engine for every daemon-backed self-grant (star a11y key filter,
 * notification-listener access). The system applies these grants asynchronously and loses
 * races around boot, APK updates and daemon restarts; a single fire-and-forget attempt
 * silently strands the feature until the next service restart (field defect: the
 * notification-listener grant never landed on-car, leaving the navi mirror and real music
 * sessions dead). Every grant therefore runs the same loop: check the TRUE system-side
 * state first, re-assert only when the grant is actually missing, retry with a delay, and
 * never disturb a healthy grant.
